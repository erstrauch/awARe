# awARe - Eliminating Implicit Bias using AR


## What is Implicit Bias?
Implicit bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes we associate with others that affect our behaviors, actions and decisions without our conscious knowledge.

And it is very _**real**_.


## What does awARe do?
We have an **immersive empathy driven** approach that we hope will enable to people to not only lear about implicit bias but also take steps to eliminate it! 

We use **Marker based AR** to allow people to simply scan an imagine and get to our app! When they scan a marker, they will get to watch a **Video Clip** that describe someone's experiences with bias at that spot! After watching, they will have an opportunity to log how they felt, and add a note about what they think they can do to help people in that situation!
